# Shadow Blocks
This was a project for the subject Object Oriented Programming in 2017 semester 2.
The spec called for a 2D game with moveable blocks which had to be put onto target tiles.
Once these tiles were filled, you advance to the next level.
Some levels implemented more obstacles including ice blocks and enemies.

It's written in Java using the slick2d library.

Feel free to take a look! :smile:
